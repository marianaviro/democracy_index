# Democracy Index: _A data visualization project_

ðŸŒŽ _Live Project Coming soon_

## Overview

Since 2004, Latin America has seen an increase in autocratic governments, many
of which came to power through democratic elections, with popular support. At
the same time, democratic countries around the world have experienced rising
levels of misinformation and disinformation. These trends contribute to
political polarization, erode trust in democratic institutions, and facilitate
the rise of anti-pluralist and authoritarian leaders. This project seeks to
explain people most prone to misinformation and disinformation different ways of
assessing if their country is losing freedom or becoming less democratic.
